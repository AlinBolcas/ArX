**TODO List:**

1. **Add Image Display Functionality:**
   - Implement a function to display images in the GUI.
   - Allow users to load images from their local filesystem.
   - Display the loaded images in the designated area of the GUI.

2. **Integrate Text-to-Speech (TTS) Functionality:**
   - Implement a TTS engine or utilize an existing library to convert text to speech.
   - Provide a text input field where users can enter text.
   - Add a button or trigger to initiate TTS conversion for the entered text.
   - Play the generated speech audio through the computer's speakers or headphones.

3. **Incorporate Speech-to-Text (SST) Functionality:**
   - Integrate a speech recognition engine to convert spoken words into text.
   - Include a button or trigger to start listening for speech input.
   - Capture the spoken words and display them in the GUI, possibly in a text area.

4. **Implement Wake Word Detection:**
   - Integrate a wake word detection system to passively listen for a specific phrase or word.
   - When the wake word is detected, activate the speech recognition functionality to process the spoken commands.

5. **Enhance User Interaction:**
   - Improve the user interface to provide feedback during image loading, TTS conversion, SST recognition, and wake word detection.
   - Display loading spinners or progress bars to indicate processing.
   - Provide clear instructions or prompts for users to interact with each feature.

6. **Error Handling and Robustness:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures in image loading, TTS conversion, SST recognition, and wake word detection.
   - Display informative error messages to users in case of failures or unexpected behaviors.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Conduct extensive testing of the integrated functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
   - Debug any issues or inconsistencies in the behavior of image loading, TTS conversion, SST recognition, and wake word detection.

8. **Documentation and User Guide:**
   - Document the usage instructions for each integrated feature.
   - Provide a user guide or manual to help users navigate and utilize the functionalities of the GUI application effectively.

**Further Enhancements:**

1. **Agent Architecture:**
   - Design and implement a modular agent architecture to manage and coordinate the functionalities of image processing, TTS, SST, and wake word detection.
   - Define interfaces and communication protocols between different agents for seamless interaction.

2. **Structural Pillars:**
   - Establish structural pillars such as data management, logging, event handling, and configuration management to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability of the application.
   - Implement mechanisms for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation to handle large volumes of images, text, and audio data efficiently.

3. **Agent Expansion:**
   - Extend the agent architecture to incorporate additional functionalities, such as natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, image recognition, and more.
   - Integrate external APIs or services for accessing advanced AI capabilities and data sources.

4. **User Customization and Personalization:**
   - Allow users to customize and personalize the application settings, preferences, and behavior according to their needs and preferences.
   - Provide options for users to configure wake word, speech recognition models, TTS voices, and other parameters.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize the performance of the application by refining algorithms, reducing computational complexity, and leveraging parallel processing techniques.
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in terms of speed, memory usage, and resource utilization.

6. **Security and Privacy:**
   - Implement security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
   - Encrypt sensitive data, secure communication channels, and implement access controls to mitigate security risks.

7. **Community Engagement and Feedback:**
   - Foster a community around the application by encouraging user feedback, feature requests, and contributions.
   - Establish communication channels such as forums, mailing lists, or social media platforms to engage with users and gather input for future enhancements.
